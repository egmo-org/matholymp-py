<span id="todo"></span><h1>Matholymp todo list<a class="headerlink" href="#matholymp-todo-list" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following lists ideas for possible changes and improvements to
matholymp, both internal and user-visible.  Many of these ideas are
speculative, I may have further ideas not written here about how a
change should be implemented and I may not always be sure that a
change would be desirable, so it would be a good idea to discuss
possible changes with me first before implementing ideas listed here.
If you are reading the version of this list in the online
documentation for a release, you should also check the current Git
version for any changes to the list.  See also <a class="reference internal" href="../contributing/#contributing"><span class="std std-ref">Contributing to matholymp</span></a>.</p>
<p>Changes are likely to be a higher priority if they are known to be of
use for a specific event that is using or planning to use matholymp.
Some entries in this list reflect known areas of variation between
different events (so would be necessary or useful if events with that
form of variation from what matholymp currently does were to choose to
adopt it).</p>
<section id="general-and-global-changes">
<h2>General and global changes<a class="headerlink" href="#general-and-global-changes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Support coordination timetabling (displaying a timetable showing
active and pending coordinations; also generating a timetable if
desired).</p></li>
<li><p>Implement better sorting of roles / contestant codes (numerical
rather than simply alphabetic) if 10 or more contestants.  (Applies
to registration system sorting as well as to main
<code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matholymp.data</span></code> sorting.)</p></li>
<li><p>Handle restricted subsets of possible scores on a problem, where the
rules of a competition do not allow all scores from 0 to the
maximum.</p></li>
<li><p>Support awards not algorithmically derived from scores and
annotations relating to awards.</p></li>
<li><p>Support disqualifications (explicitly showing that there was one
rather than just removing people and countries).</p></li>
<li><p>Support name orders other than given-family.</p></li>
<li><p>Support mononymous people.</p></li>
<li><p>Support multilingual output support rather than just English.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid Y10K problems (throughout, allow more-than-4-digit years).</p></li>
<li><p>Make all static site and registration system text generated from
Python code rather than templates more customisable.</p></li>
<li><p>Add graphical statistics of results and individual and country
performance over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Support distinguishing official and unofficial countries and
contestants in tables by using different CSS styles.</p></li>
<li><p>Support gender as optionally public information (generally or for
contestants).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow SVG images of flags and generate PNG automatically for LaTeX
inclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow for a global configuration file rather than separate files for
each part of the system; also allow scripts to read multiple
configuration files (shared and non-shared).</p></li>
<li><p>Add web interfaces for more things currently done on command line.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t hardcode <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">en_GB</span></code> as locale for collation.</p></li>
<li><p>Include Python API documentation in generated documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Add automated testing for error cases in scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistently pass ids to <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">file_url_to_local()</span></code> as integers,
not sometimes integers (document generation) and sometimes strings
(<strong class="command">mo-static-import</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Make capitalization of exception messages consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Take advantage of missing CSV entries being output as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">''</span></code> by
Python by default to simplify code.</p></li>
<li><p>Use more specific exception classes rather than <code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ValueError</span></code>
etc. everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Review code style against the current version of <span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="pep reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/"><strong>PEP 8</strong></a> and fix or
update style accordingly.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="static-site">
<h2>Static site<a class="headerlink" href="#static-site" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Allow CSV files to specify event short and long names, and the
number of contestants for ranking, so those can vary from year to
year.</p></li>
<li><p>Support not showing the host country / city if always the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Support (in matholymp rather than through hardcoding redirects in
web server configuration) merging people; removing people (if later
determined not to have been there, etc.); incomplete scores or names
information for old events.  E.g., add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Redirect</span> <span class="pre">Person</span> <span class="pre">Numbers</span></code>
column in <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">people.csv</span></code> plus allowing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Annual</span> <span class="pre">URL</span></code> to be a
comma-separated list, together with <strong class="command">mo-static-upgrade</strong>
support, tests and documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a general index of all problem papers for all years.</p></li>
<li><p>Support a host country that did not previously take part (e.g., when
a planned host splits up, or for a completely new event), and
generally ensure the site looks sensible when there are no past
events.</p></li>
<li><p>Make <strong class="command">mo-static-generate</strong> support running a command to
postprocess its output, or commands to postprocess and push to
production.</p></li>
<li><p>Make <strong class="command">mo-static-import</strong> ignore excess data (e.g., from
having the full version of <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">people.csv</span></code> instead of the public
version) rather than giving errors for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make <strong class="command">mo-static-import</strong> support downloading all data itself
(including medal boundaries, via the medal_boundaries_csv action),
and setting medal boundaries, so just running
<strong class="command">mo-static-import</strong> with no arguments does everything needed
after an event to transfer data to the static site.  At present, it
can download most data, but not medal boundaries, and requires a
directory to be specified explicitly.</p></li>
<li><p>Make <strong class="command">mo-static-import</strong> and
<strong class="command">mo-static-papers-import</strong> support automatically running
<strong class="command">mo-static-generate</strong> (possibly with postprocessing
commands).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="registration-system">
<h2>Registration system<a class="headerlink" href="#registration-system" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Support bulk emails (announcements) to registration contacts.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend automatic checks / warnings for all-uppercase names: also
warn on the registration status page.</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly make <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">person.item.html</span></code> advise people of the
recommended maximum file size for photos (in human-friendly form
rather than a raw number of bytes).  File extension and contents
should also be checked to agree with MIME type.  Apply checks also
to flags and photos reused from previous years, but quietly don’t
reuse in that case if format and extension mismatch.</p></li>
<li><p>Add more automation for rotating photos server-side.</p></li>
<li><p>Restrict access to retired photos and flags, similar to the
restrictions on access to retired person and country records.  (This
is a corner case, since access is already restricted to the photos
and flags for retired person and country records, and to the
non-current photos and flags for all person and country records.)</p></li>
<li><p>Add user interface for removing a language, replacing all requests
for it by requests for a given other language.</p></li>
<li><p>In the registration system, show more past participation information
rather than just a link.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate automatic suggestions of possible past participation links
where same name and same country or staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for registration contact to view room allocations for their
country and people sharing rooms with them.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for automatic room allocation based on information about the
capacities of available rooms and which rooms should have people in
which roles.</p></li>
<li><p>Support upload of sound files with pronunciation of participant
names.</p></li>
<li><p>Support other registration information where useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Use database to describe maximum / expected number of people in a
given role from a country rather than hardcoding.</p></li>
<li><p>Use database to describe other role properties rather than
hardcoding based on names (also applies to some other things,
e.g., document generation).  This includes at least contestant
number, whether should have phone number.  (Need to pass some
information through to CSV files so registration status generation
can work from those.)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow other options for which roles are (initially) expected to have
phone numbers instead of just participants guiding countries; this
also affects the explanatory text about missing phone numbers.
(More complicated if allowed for non-staff participants as well as
staff.)</p></li>
<li><p>Support for sending emails to registration contacts with reminders
about missing data, and summaries of present data.</p></li>
<li><p>Support bulk upload of registration details for people.</p></li>
<li><p>Support self-registration accounts (that can register a single
person in a particular role only, for both staff and normal
countries, so people can enter some of their own data).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all tables in the registration system use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thead</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tbody</span></code> to facilitate uses involving sortable tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for not publishing scores until the results are final, or
for hiding some scores until all are entered or until the results
are final, for events wanting such restrictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Add more registration system sanity checks against mistakes by
administrative users (open-ended issue).</p></li>
<li><p>Support multiple new people being the same person on the static site
(e.g., same new person as deputy for multiple countries, such as
host country main and B teams).</p></li>
<li><p>Move more registration system code out of
<code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matholymp.roundupreg</span></code> rather than depending on Roundup
interfaces (facilitates code sharing between multiple registration
back ends).  At least, most of the logic for scaling down photos and
maybe most of the caching code.</p></li>
<li><p>Support automatic suggestions of possible medal boundaries, with
information provided about how close those boundaries are to ideal
on various metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>Add more automated testing for registration system code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following ideas are more speculative.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Reduce the differences between static site and registration system
CSV files (generally, include more data in registration system
files, at least once results complete).</p></li>
<li><p>Add more sanity checks for past participation information (not
allowing multiple countries pointing to same past country, or
pointing to past staff countries).</p></li>
<li><p>Support Unicode sorting of names in the registration system in more
cases.  The main ones are done, but this theoretically applies to
lists of members of many classes that don’t go through matholymp
code.  Also e.g. “plain” versions of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">other_roles</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">guide_for</span></code> may not have the desired sorting.</p></li>
<li><p>Add RSS feeds of new registered participants and changes to public
participant details (old versions of changed data maybe shouldn’t be
public, but could still indicate that something has changed or is
new).</p></li>
<li><p>Make registration system code avoid time-of-check / time-of-use race
conditions (registering multiple people with the same role from the
same country at the same time; creating / editing countries to
duplicate country codes at the same time; entering scores for
multiple problems for the same country at the same time; conceivably
others).</p></li>
<li><p>Support retiring special countries, as long as this doesn’t affect
the special “anonymous” or “admin” users.</p></li>
<li><p>Support logical role ordering within countries rather than only
alphabetical.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a public list of country contacts.  Or a private list for future
hosts, or both with support for different contacts on the two lists.
Add support for editing contacts that affects future years as well.
(More generally, add automation for keeping user account passwords
from year to year.)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow people to enter just time for arrival / departure if on the
standard dates.</p></li>
<li><p>Support entering ranges for scores during coordination, so that
medal boundaries can be considered based on such partial
information.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="document-generation">
<h2>Document generation<a class="headerlink" href="#document-generation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Don’t hardcode English as a language to give to all leaders.</p></li>
<li><p>Make draft papers say somewhere which draft version they are.</p></li>
<li><p>Add more thorough testing for <strong class="command">mo-document-generate</strong>
(background and logo PDFs, flags, photos, inclusion of room / phone
numbers on badges, actual contents of LaTeX files, escaping of names
and accented characters in documents).</p></li>
<li><p>Add borders round flags on name badges (and website?).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow labels for contestant desks to show more than two languages.</p></li>
